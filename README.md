# MMTextNormalizer

This is a small function that normalizes Myanmar text. It can be used to normalize MM text after converting to Unicode from Zawgyi.
The rules are found while doing thesis and working on some projects. Please don't hesitate to open issue if you found any new rule or error.

Sincerely,

Aye Hninn Khine
