# MMStringNormalizer

This is a small function that normalizes Myanmar string. It can be used to normalize MM string after converting to Unicode from Zawgyi.
The rules are collected as much as I can while doing my thesis. Please don't hesitate to open issue if you found any new rule or error.

Sincerely,

Aye Hninn Khine
